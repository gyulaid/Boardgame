Boardgame
=========

This game is a game played on a 6x7 square sized map, with 7 red and 7 blue disks on it.
Each player plays with the disks of one of the colors.
They are able to step one by one after each other.
> A disk can be moved forward or diagonally, if the destination spot is empty

> A disk can be moved diagonally, if an other player's disk is on the destination spot
>> In this case, the other player's disk must be removed from the game

There are two restricted squares that you can not step on.

A player wins if the other one can not make a move.
